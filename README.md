Project: Animal Shelter Adoption Analysis

Project Goal:
To understand which factors influence animal adoptions in a shelter:
*Which animals are adopted most frequently?
*Does breed, gender, age, or color matter?
*What are the most common outcomes for animals (adoption, euthanasia, return to owner)?
*Are there differences between dogs and cats?


1. Which animals are adopted most frequently?
Dogs and cats are the most frequently adopted animals.
Based on the intake and adoption data, dogs are adopted slightly more often than cats.

2. Does breed, gender, age, or color matter?
Yes, these factors influence adoption rates:

Breed: Certain breeds, especially mixed-breed dogs, are adopted more frequently than others.
Gender: Gender matters — for example, neutered males and spayed females are adopted more often compared to unaltered animals.
Age: Younger animals (especially those under one year of age) are significantly more likely to be adopted.
Color: Color has an impact as well — animals with more common or lighter coat colors (e.g., black and white, brown) tend to be adopted more quickly.

3. What are the most common outcomes for animals (adoption, euthanasia, return to owner)?
Adoption is by far the most common outcome for animals at the shelter.
Other outcomes, such as return to owner or euthanasia, occur much less frequently.

4. Are there differences between dogs and cats?
Yes, there are differences:

Dogs are admitted to the shelter more frequently than cats.
Dogs also tend to have slightly higher adoption rates compared to cats.
