Project: Animal Shelter Adoption Analysis

Project Goal:
To understand which factors influence animal adoptions in a shelter:
*Which animals are adopted most frequently?
*Does breed, gender, age, or color matter?
*What are the most common outcomes for animals (adoption, euthanasia, return to owner)?
*Are there differences between dogs and cats?
